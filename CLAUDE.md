# Claude Code Init File - Campfire Ads

This file contains project context and commonly used commands for the Campfire Ads podcast advertising platform.

## 📋 Quick Architecture Reference

**⚡ For complete architecture details, see: [`stack.md`](./stack.md)**  
The stack.md file contains the full microservices architecture specification, service communication patterns, performance targets, and migration roadmap.

## 🚨 **CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT RULE**

**🔍 BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE - ALWAYS CHECK THESE IN ORDER:**

### 1. **Check API Gateway Routes First** 📡
- **ALWAYS examine `api-gateway/src/routes/` before building new services**
- **Understand existing endpoints** - API Gateway may already proxy to your service
- **Match expected API contracts** - Services must implement what Gateway expects
- **Check service names** - HTTPClient uses specific service names for routing
- **Review request/response patterns** - Follow established data flow

### 2. **Check Common Folder** 📁
- **Check for existing utilities**: `common/middleware/`, `common/config/`, `common/types/`
- **Reuse shared components**: Authentication, validation, security, database connections
- **Follow established patterns**: TypeScript interfaces, error handling, logging
- **Extend existing code**: Don't duplicate functionality that already exists
- **Check imports**: See what other services are already using from common/

**The `common/` folder contains:**
- 🛡️ **Security middleware** - Authentication, rate limiting, validation  
- ⚙️ **Configuration utilities** - Environment-specific settings
- 🔧 **Shared types** - TypeScript interfaces and schemas
- 📊 **Database utilities** - Connection pooling, migrations
- 🚨 **Error handling** - Standardized error responses

### 3. **Architecture Flow Understanding** 🏗️
```
Dashboard → API Gateway → Microservices → Database
    ↓           ↓              ↓           ↓
   React    Proxy/Auth     Business     PostgreSQL
          Validation      Logic        Connection
```

### 4. **Consolidate Duplications** 🧹
- **Check for duplicate files** - types, middleware, utilities across services
- **Remove redundant code** - consolidate into common/ folder
- **Update imports** - ensure all services use common utilities
- **Test after cleanup** - verify services still compile and work

### 5. **🚨 CRITICAL: Authentication Pattern** 🔐
**NEVER use individual auth middleware in service routes - use global JWT validation only!**

❌ **WRONG** - Individual auth middleware in routes:
```typescript
// DON'T DO THIS in routes/creatives.ts:
const authMiddleware = createAuthMiddleware({
  secret: process.env.JWT_SECRET
});
router.post('/', authMiddleware.validateJWT, ...)
```

✅ **CORRECT** - Rely on global auth from app.ts:
```typescript
// In app.ts (GLOBAL):
app.use('/creatives', authMiddleware.validateJWT, creativesRouter);

// In routes/creatives.ts (NO AUTH MIDDLEWARE):
router.post('/', asyncHandler(async (req: AuthenticatedRequest, res) => {
  const userId = req.user?.id; // ✅ Available from global auth
  // Route logic here
}))
```

**Why this matters:**
- ✅ **Prevents auth conflicts** - No duplicate JWT parsing
- ✅ **Ensures ownership security** - User can only access their own data
- ✅ **Consistent patterns** - Same as campaigns, podcasts, episodes
- ❌ **Individual auth causes malformed token errors** 
- ❌ **Individual auth allows cross-user data access vulnerabilities**

**This prevents:**
- ❌ Building services that don't match Gateway expectations
- ❌ Code duplication across services  
- ❌ Inconsistent API contracts
- ❌ Missing authentication/security patterns
- ❌ Maintenance nightmare from duplicate code
- ❌ **Auth conflicts and security vulnerabilities** 🚨

## 🔄 **DOCUMENTATION UPDATE RULE**

**🚨 CRITICAL: When completing any major phase or milestone:**

1. **Update all three documentation files in order:**
   - `README.md` - Project overview, quick start, current features
   - `CLAUDE.md` - Development commands, testing procedures, current status  
   - `stack.md` - Architecture progress, phase completion, performance results

2. **Update content consistently across files:**
   - ✅ Mark completed phases and features
   - 🔄 Update "Next" sections and roadmap
   - 📊 Add performance results and testing outcomes
   - 🏗️ Reflect current project structure

3. **Commit documentation updates together:**
   - Create single commit with all three file updates
   - Use descriptive commit message explaining what was completed
   - Ensure future Claude sessions get accurate project state

**This ensures documentation stays synchronized and Claude sessions have accurate context.**

### Generate Test JWT Token
```bash
cd api-gateway
node -e "
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const token = jwt.sign(
  { id: 'test-user', email: 'test@example.com', role: 'podcaster' },
  'development-jwt-secret-key',
  { expiresIn: '1h' }
);
console.log('Bearer ' + token);
"
```

### 🛡️ Security Testing & Validation

#### Test Authentication
```bash
# Test invalid JWT (should return 401)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/podcasters \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token"

# Test valid JWT (should route to service and fail gracefully when service unavailable)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/podcasters \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <valid-jwt-token>"

# Test missing authentication (should return 401)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/podcasters
```

#### Test Rate Limiting
```bash
# Test general rate limiting (make multiple requests)
for i in {1..10}; do curl http://localhost:3000/health; done

# Test RTB rate limiting (high frequency requests)
for i in {1..50}; do 
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ads/bid \
    -H "x-api-key: development-api-key-change-in-production" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"episode_id":"test","ad_slot":{"position":"pre_roll","duration":30}}' &
done
```

#### Test Security Features
```bash
# Test security headers
curl -I http://localhost:3000/health

# Test CORS
curl -H "Origin: https://example.com" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: GET" \
  -X OPTIONS http://localhost:3000/api/podcasters

# Test input validation (should return 400 with validation errors)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/campaigns \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <valid-jwt>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"invalid": "data"}'
```

### 🔧 Security Configuration

#### Environment-Specific Security
```bash
# Development (relaxed security)
NODE_ENV=development npm run dev:secure

# Staging (moderate security)
NODE_ENV=staging npm run dev:secure

# Production (maximum security)
NODE_ENV=production npm run start:secure
```

#### Security Environment Variables
```bash
# Required for production
export JWT_SECRET="your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key"
export API_KEY="your-production-api-key"

export RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS="900000"      # 15 minutes
export RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS="5000"     # Max requests per window
```
