## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ LTS
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional)
- Git

### 🚀 Complete Platform (Phase 2A.5 Complete!)

Full two-sided marketplace with role-based business logic is ready:

```bash
# Quick start - Complete Platform with Docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose.full.yml up --build -d

# Access: http://localhost:3001 (dashboard)
# API: http://localhost:3000 (gateway)
```

**Test Accounts with Role-Based Workflows:**
- **Podcaster (Supply Side)**: `test@example.com` / `password123` / `podcaster`
  - Navigation: My Podcasts → Episodes → Ad Slots → CPM Pricing
- **Advertiser (Demand Side)**: `advertiser@example.com` / `password123` / `advertiser`
  - Navigation: Browse Inventory → Available Slots → Create Campaigns
